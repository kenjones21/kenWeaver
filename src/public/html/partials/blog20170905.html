      Transportation constitutes Philadelphia's second biggest source of greenhouse gas
      emissions, after buildings. To this point, however, transportation has remained an
      intractable source of emissions, even in places like

      where there has been
      substantial progress in reducing emissions.

      A <a href="http://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/now/
		 pdfs/Reducing%20GHG%20in%20Philadelphia.ashx?la=en">
	recent report
      </a>
      from Drexel University details various scenarios by which the city can
      reduce its emissions. Somewhat disturbingly, only one of their scenarios
      for transportation reaches the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in emissions, and this
      scenario includes a large buildout of renewables, which would reach 49% of the electricity
      mix (from 2% currently) and nuclear, which would reach 40% of the electricity mix (from 27%
      currently). Coupled with an increase in electricity demand that is necessary to
      decarbonize the energy system, this scenario represents a somewhat ambitious case
      for the electricity sector moving forward. However, it's not clear why the study chose
      49% renewables as an optimistic case given that studies have shown
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/re_futures/">
	80% of renewable electricity is feasible for the US. 
      </a>
      In addition to this "optimistic" electricity mix, the scenario that reaches the 80%
      reduction in emissions also includes significant behavior change, with large increases
      in the public's use of walking, biking, and public transit. Given that this is probably
      policy over which the city has the most control, I'd like to focus on this part of policy.

      As of right now (5:15 PM on a Tuesday) it would take me 20 minutes to drive to city hall.
      This is without considering the time to find a parking spot once I get there. Alternatively,
      I could bike (23 minutes) or take public transit (17 minutes). So then why do people drive
      in the city? After all, many monthly car payments are comparable to lifetime costs for
      bikes. Of course, not all places in the city are equally accesible via public transit,
      so for those who prefer not to bike, a car may be the only option. But one can then beg
      the question "Why don't more people prefer to bike?"

      One possible reason is the lack of safe infrastructure for bikes. 
      Despite there being only <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html">five vehicles per ten residents.</a>, essentially
      all infrastructure in the city is designed for automobile use, without the safety of
      bicyclists in mind.
