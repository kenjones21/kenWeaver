      So I think I just want to use this space for us to put ideas down for builds, as well
      as organize big projects. A few people have expressed interest in building a city, so
      with any luck I'll be able to make some tools that will help with that.

      Okay so some city building notes for us.

      For right now, I think we should try and leave the swamp as it is. Please don't chop
      down any trees, since there is no way to get swamp trees to grow (planting oak trees
      just gives you normal oak trees). Also, try not to do too much mountain leveling or
      terraforming just yet, until we get settled. That's all I've got!
