# My Personal Website

#### Ken Weaver

This is my open source, personal website. I am currently migrating to a
Django/Angular setup, and this is very much still a work in progress.

### Installation

To install:
1. Setup a new virtual environment: `python3 -m venv /path/to/venv`.
2. Activate virtual environment: `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
3. Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run migrations: `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Run django: `python3 manage.py runserver`
